This guide will help you install and run program on your computer. The program consists of just two simple steps: cloning the repository and running the `main.py` file. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Before you begin, make sure you have Git installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the official website [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

1. Open your terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, to clone it to the root of your C: drive:

   ```bash
   cd C:\
   ```

3. Now, clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```

   Replace `https://github.com/your-repository-url.git` with the actual URL of your repository.

4. Git will clone the repository into the chosen directory.

## Step 2: Run My Program

1. Once the repository is successfully cloned, navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd path-to-repository
   ```

   Here, `path-to-repository` is the path to the directory where you cloned the repository.

2. Now, you can run the `main.py` file using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Make sure Python is installed on your computer.

3. It may not work as expected on the first try, in which case run main.py again.

4. The program will start running, and you can begin using its functionality.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed and run My Program on your computer! You can now start using it as intended.
